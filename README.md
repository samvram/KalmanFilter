# Kalman Filter Implementation

This project is done for the completion of Quiz 2 of **VI Semester** of Radar Systems. The project is aimed at showing the effectiveness of Kalman Filtering techniques.

## Question
A fighter jet flying at the height of 30,000 feet at the speed of 500 kmph, drops a missile. We need to make a Kalman Filter Estimation of the simulation for

* No drag case
* A drag force being applied on both axes

## Results

![Trajectories](Actual_paths.jpg)

This is the simulation result showing the actual trajectories of the missile without any measurement and observation noise

![Trajectory with Noise](Trajectory_without_drag.jpg)

This shows the trajectory without drag but with observation and measurement noise.

![Errors without drag](Errors_without_drag.jpg)

These are the various errors without drag

![Trajectory with Noise and Drag](trajecory_drag.jpg)

This is the trjectory of the path with drag and noise.

![Errors with Drag](Drag_Errors.jpg)

This showcases errors with drag and the Kalman Estimation.
